# ImagesDB

Hello, 
I am new to github and MySQL. I am trying to put together a database which can put in relation images and texts. The goal is to make it user friendly (for me) and create a public interface for the public to access the data I have processed. I hope this makes sense. 
Any help will be much appreciated!
